# VitalSource API Class

A class I made to interact with the VitalSource API: https://developer.vitalsource.com/hc/en-us/categories/360001974433

It currently only makes 3 calls: Create Code, Check Code Status, and Cancel/Refund Code. 

I did not include any API actions made on behalf of a specific user, as they were not necessary for my use-case -- they would require additional interaction to request an access token on behalf of the user, using their username and password.
